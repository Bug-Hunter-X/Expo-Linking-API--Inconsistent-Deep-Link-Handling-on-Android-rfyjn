To improve reliability, consider implementing a combination of strategies:

1. **Foreground Service:** When the app is in the background, use a foreground service to listen for intents. This allows the app to receive deep links even when closed or in the background.

2. **`Linking.getInitialURLAsync()`:** Before setting up the event listener, use `Linking.getInitialURLAsync()` to capture any initial URL that may have launched the app. This catches the case where a deep link was used to open the app initially.

3. **Additional Event Listeners:** If the situation calls for it, explore implementing event listeners for specific intents or broadcasts (depending on your deep linking mechanism) outside of the Expo `Linking` API. This can act as a fallback solution if `Linking.addEventListener` does not work correctly.   

The `expoDeepLinkSolution.js` demonstrates a better solution by using `Linking.getInitialURLAsync` to handle cases where the app was launched via a deep link.

**Note:** The best solution is often context dependent.   If the app's deep linking requirements demand a high level of reliability and background processing, a foreground service may be the most robust approach.
