This bug occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `Linking.addEventListener` method might not fire consistently across different Android devices or versions. Specifically, the event listener may fail to register, leading to no response when a deep link is opened. This is especially problematic when dealing with links opened while the application is in the background.
